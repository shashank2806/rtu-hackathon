Problem Statement

 Design a machine learning algorithm to predict the rent of a property. You will have following data available

    1) 100,000 property data from a particular City. Will have around 50 attributes of the property
    2) Data of the neighborhood of these properties

You are free to source more data as needed.
Given a new property your algorithm should be able to predict a rent range of the property.
